Statements
A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.
In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.
The following statement prints the text "Python is fun!" to the screen:
"""
print("Python is fun!")
"""
In Python, a statement usually ends when the line ends. You do not need to use a semicolon (;) 
like in many other programming languages (for example, Java or C).

#multipe statements:
